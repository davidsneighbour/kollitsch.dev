A slight spoiler warning for the third season of "Star Trek: Picard" ahead.

I am binging currently (maybe later some notes about this habit) the third and final season of "Star Trek: Picard." So many of my "peers" were unhappy about it and the whole three-season run. I don't get why (well, I get it; they are stuck in the 90's), and I love every little bit of it. I am not going to spoil anything, but I am going to talk about Enterprise E.

It appears there was an Enterprise E that was destroyed at some point. In episode 3 of season 3, Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) reveals that he rebuilt Enterprise-D. However, he also mentioned that he couldn't use Enterprise-E. He says, "And obviously, we can't use the Enterprise E." Which implies that Enterprise-E was unfixably destroyed. But how?

After he says that, everyone looks suspiciously at Worf, who says, "That wasn't my fault." I giggled.

Then I googled a bit, but there seems to be no "public knowledge" of how Enterprise E lost its opportunity to appear in Picard's third season. We will see this in season 1 of "Star Trek: Worf," I guess. 🤣

While some see those series as fan service, I see them as a continuation of the idea of Star Trek for newer generations, short attention spans (10 episodes vs. 24 in a season), and new story arches that are not bound to the old canon. I am looking forward to the new Star Trek series and hope they will be as good as those three seasons of Picard.

And now, after writing this post, I will watch the last episode of Picard season 3. Let's hope it delivers. 🖖
