I [recently](/blog/2022/notes-from-the-laboratory-february/) started taking part in the [`#100DaysToOffload`](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge. It's a challenge that tries to create a larger output of content that is interesting and useful. I will try to write about the topics that I have learned during this time while still staying to be the nerd that I am.

> The whole point of #100DaysToOffload is to challenge you to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year.

I really think a better hashtag would have been #100PostsToOffload. But I have no reason to have an opinion on this. The "rules" are as follows:

> There are some simple and reasonable guidelines if you want to take part in #100DaysToOffload:
>
> *   This needs to be done on a personal blog, not a corporate blog. If you don’t have a personal blog, you can sign up for a free one at Write.as.
> *   There is no specific start date. Your 100 posts can start or end whenever you want them to.
> *   Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year.
> *   There are no limits to what you can post about – write about whatever interests you.
> *   Once you have published an article, don’t forget to post a link on your social media with the hashtag #100DaysToOffload.
> *   Get your friends involved!

I think I learned about this challenge on [Kaushal Modi's blog](https://scripter.co/auto-count-100daystooffload-posts/), whom I am hereby challenging to have a lower period of completion of this challenge. I shall add an indicator of progress in the next days to these posts. Let's make this about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and stuff that makes the internet better. Accept the challenge!
