Ólafur Arnalds remix of Rammstein's "Zeit" is something perfect.

His own notes about this from [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/olafurarnalds/posts/506424670842393):

> When I was 15 years old Rammstein came to Reykjavík. This was going to be one of the biggest shows in Icelandic history. Me and my friends went and headbanged our teenage hearts out. 20 years later I was asked to rework their latest single.

Great to see those two creative universes coming together.
