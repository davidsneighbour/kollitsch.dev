There are things that shouldn't need to be said anymore, yet somehow still do. Every few weeks someone on the internet manages to confidently reinvent a mistake the rest of us have already made, documented, and moved past. Sometimes it's a carousel. Sometimes it's an "AI-generated thought piece." Sometimes it's just another "you there?" in a developer chat instead of a real question.

This page collects essays, blog posts, and rants that align with how I think about the web - how it should be built, discussed, and used. They're not my own, but they echo the same frustration and care for craft that drive my own work.

If you've ever wondered why I react a bit too strongly to a "small design tweak" or a "quick tech suggestion," this is the reading list that explains it. Consider it a survival guide for understanding why some of us still believe ***that the web deserves better***.

## Core Principles

### [Stop Citing AI](https://stopcitingai.com/)

AI doesn't "say" things. It rearranges other people's words in statistically convenient ways. Quoting it as an authority is like citing your toaster because it once browned bread in the shape of your favourite philosopher. If you want to make an argument, use your own brain — it still ships with a warranty.

## Internet Etiquette

### [Don't Ask to Ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)

The fastest way to get help online is to actually ask your question. Opening with "Can I ask a question?" only delays both of us from getting to the part where I might be able to help you. This site explains why skipping the ceremony is a kindness to everyone involved.

### [No Hello](https://nohello.net/en/)

Starting a chat with "Hello" and then waiting for me to respond is the digital equivalent of knocking and running away. We're all busy; just write what you need. No suspense, no awkward pauses, no unnecessary greetings — just context. It's not rude, it's efficient.

## Design Dogma

### [Should I Use a Carousel?](https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/)

If your design idea involves a carousel, stop and read this first. The data is clear, the UX research is older than some frameworks, and users still ignore them. Carousels are what happen when no one in the room wants to argue. Be the one who argues.
