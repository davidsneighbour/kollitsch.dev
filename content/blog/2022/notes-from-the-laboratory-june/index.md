I am trying this new "thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year, and monthly reviews just sound like something normal people would do. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

- **Focus:** I didn't had much focus this month due to travelling and subsequent "other" life events. I dove into work and smaller things to fix. July will go better I guess.
- **Pokki:** well...
  ![All that's left](/blog/2022/notes-from-the-laboratory-june/all-thats-left.jpg)
- **Language Learning:** Not much done on this front either.
- **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
