Wes Anderson has directed a three-minute commercial for Montblanc, mostly known for its fountain pens, commemorating the 100-year anniversary of the brand's Meisterstück fountain pen. This commercial. Titled "100 Years of Meisterstück" it features Anderson's signature aesthetic, blending eccentric storytelling with meticulous layouted visuals.

In the short film, Anderson himself acts and is joined by Rupert Friend and Jason Schwartzman as characters at the fictional Montblanc Headquarters atop Mont Blanc. They present the pen's story, its cultural legacy and luxurious craftsmanship through the filmmaker's distinctive, whimsical lens. Both actors worked with Anderson on "The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar".

The Meisterstück pen is celebrated for its historical influence and timeless elegance and somehow I believe that this is exactly Andersons type of pen :) and the commercial is scripted hilariously unscriptedly with lots of over-talking and detail nibbling.

The commercial also hints at Montblanc's other luxury products --- "And also, ehm, watches" --- "And leather..." --- "And more leather goods".

Entertaining. And: "There's two slogans!"
