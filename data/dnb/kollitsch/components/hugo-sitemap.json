This is deprecated, but currently still supported. The module will echo a note on CLI about this.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* build: update Github organization & use newer NPM dependencies by @ringods in https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-sitemap/pull/39\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ringods made their first contribution in https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-sitemap/pull/39\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-sitemap/compare/v0.0.3...v1.0.1",
