In Hugo v0.131.0, there's an exciting update: the image hashing process now uses `xxHash`, which is much speedier compared to the old MD5 hashing. It trims down those lengthy processed image filenames to a minimum.

But, here is the catch: this nifty update means all your images will be re-processed, potentially causing longer initial build times and even some timeouts.

```plaintext
Error: error building site: render: failed to render pages: render of "page" failed:
"/home/patrick/github.com/davidsneighbour/kollitsch.dev/layouts/_default/single.html:9:22":
execute of template failed:
template: _default/single.html:9:22:
executing "main" at <partials.Include>:
error calling Include: partial "content/post.html" timed out after 30s.
This is most likely due to infinite recursion. If this is just a slow
template, you can try to increase the 'timeout' config setting.
```

No worries, though! Just add this line to your `hugo.toml` or `config.toml`:

```toml
timeout = "600s"
```

This simple hack prolongs the timeout for image processing and ensures your first build runs smoothly, and after that, it's back to the usual speedy Hugo goodness.
