Google has a nice little animation when you end up on a search result with no results. It's a little blue monster fishing. Click it and it will start fishing for something. A fish, or a tin of fishes or, well, look for yourself. I am normally not a fan of animations on functional pages, but this one is cute-ishâ€¦
