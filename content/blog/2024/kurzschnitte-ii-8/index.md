Welcome to the eight edition of Kurzschnitte II. The number eight, also the atomic number of oxygen, holds significant interest in various contexts. It has been argued that, since the cardinal number seven is the highest number of items that can be universally processed as a single set, the etymology of "eight" might reflect a composite nature, seen as "twice four" or "two short of ten." In our Solar System, following Pluto's reclassification as a dwarf planet on August 24th, 2006 (meh), eight bodies are now recognized as planets orbiting the Sun. Additionally, eight is the first composite number, neither prime nor semiprime.

Having said that, here are the links for this edition:
