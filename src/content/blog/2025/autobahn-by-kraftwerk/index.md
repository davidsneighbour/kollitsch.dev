    title: Autobahn by Kraftwerk (Psychedelic Short Film)

This video is a wild little 12-minute 1979 animated film by Roger Mainwood, underlined by Kraftwerk's *Autobahn*.

Rather than showing literal cars or motorways, the sequence sends an alien-human figure drifting, floating, flying and sailing through deep psychedelic, abstract landscapes in an eerie, hypnotic visual trip.

This film came early in Mainwood's career; he later worked on the cult animation Heavy Metal (1981) as an animator. Halas & Batchelor, the producers, meanwhile carry their own long legacy in British animation.

As for Kraftwerk: they're often regarded as the pioneering band in electronic music - arguably *the* first widely influential electronic music band - and the original song *Autobahn* (1974) helped cement their reputation.

If you're curious: this film is tucked away in the weird corners of the internet, a surreal intersection of early video art, music, and animation.

PS: There is, by the way, a [making of video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlVLd4bE7Ss) that goes into more detail about the production process behind the film --- if you can follow it through the grainy and slightly more psychedelic footage.
