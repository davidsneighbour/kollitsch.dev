The following is a collection of tools helping me with my digital and work life. My main focus lies in applications that are open source and usable across operating systems. This is a collection in progress, so check back or subscribe to updates to know when there is something new to know about.

## Operating system

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is my main operating system. I use it on my desktop, and it's running on a server I am using. The last time I used Windows on my desktop was in 2004.

## Productivity

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is my main task manager. I use it to manage my tasks, and I am using it to manage my projects. I am using it on the phone, via the Linux app, and via web interface.

I stay up to date with news and development by using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) as online feed reader.

## Privacy and security

My password manager of choice is [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) and I am using it on all my devices.

## Email

Tbd.

## Organization

Calendar via Google Calendar, Contacts via Google Contacts, Notes via Google Keep, Files via Google Drive.

## Notes, drafts and writing

For handwritten notes I am using [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com) and for digital notes I am using [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).

## Shell and terminal

To be written… Default Terminal with a bunch of Dotfiles.

## Code Editor

To be written… VSCode, PHPStorm, Sublime Text

## RSS reader

## Bookmarks

Raindrop.

## Cloud storage

## Look and feel

To be written… Nothing ;) I stopped trying to optimize my look and feel. I am using the default theme of Ubuntu and the default theme of VSCode.

## UI

To be written… Isn't that what Look and Feel is about?

## Extensions

To be written… Not sure what I was thinking here… I am using a lot of extensions in VSCode, but I am not sure if I want to list them all here.

## Hardware

To be written… ~~Two mediocre all in one stations, one by Acer (never again), one by HP (fake strong).~~

## Password Management
