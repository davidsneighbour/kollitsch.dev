I have a soft spot for strange and oddly specific words from all kinds of languages. Some describe emotions we never quite name, others capture habits we all recognise but rarely talk about. Every now and then I come across one that fits perfectly into everyday life, and today it's time for one of those gems.

Kuchisabishii is a Japanese word that translates to "lonely mouth". It describes the moments when you eat not because you're hungry, but because you are bored and "your mouth" (yeah, sure) wants something to do. Maybe you're snacking while watching TV. Maybe you're chewing gum because work is stressful. Maybe you're picking at something before dinner because the silence in your mouth feels strange. It's all kuchisabishii.

What makes the word so interesting is how neutral it is. English often pushes these behaviours into terms like binge eating or overeating, which come loaded with guilt. Kuchisabishii simply names the feeling without judgement. It's a habit, a comfort, a distraction, a little mouth boredom. Nothing more dramatic than that.

It's a tiny linguistic gift: a way to talk about a familiar behaviour without labelling it as a problem. And honestly, who hasn't had a lonely mouth now and then?
