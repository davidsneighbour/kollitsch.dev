It's that time of the month again where I am trying this "new thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

* **100DaysToOffload:** I recently realised, that *theoretically* this whole 100 posts in one year thingy here on the blog is going on for 1.5 years now and I came nowhere near the 100 posts planned. Also, *technically* speaking I would need to post every three days to get to 100 posts in a year. So I am not sure if that will ever happen, because I am hesitant to post uninteresting (to me) stuff just to get the numbers higher. By the way, the 65 in the list of total posts in the project is wrong too, it should calculate only posts in the past 365 days. I will fix that soon. Anywayâ€¦ Maybe I should post weekly reviews instead of monthly ones to get numbers higher ;]
* **Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger:** [Last time](/blog/2023/notes-from-the-laboratory-may) I mentioned how my whole set of hardware went dead during the recent heatwave and noted, how HP computers seem to be the most resilient. I am not taking that back, but resilient doesn't mean they stay alive for long and so my last computer left me a couple of weeks ago. A nightly visit at the local nerd-agglomeration saved me and I am now the proud owner of "Behemoth", an overly equipped computer that (hopefully) will last me a couple of years. I am not going to list the specs here, but it's a beast for what I was using up to now. It has 500times the RAM that my first computer had (probably just for a bit, I can double that). Now calculate my age :D
* **GoHugo Modules:** I did some updates to some GoHugo modules. Not that anybody (other than myself in my projects) is using them, but I wanted them up-to-date to some recent developments. Things are happening.
* **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
