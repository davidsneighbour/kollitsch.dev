This document outlines security procedures and general policies for projects by David's Neighbour.

* [Reporting a bug](#reporting-a-bug)
* [Disclosure policy](#disclosure-policy)
* [Comments on this policy](#comments-on-this-policy)

## Reporting a bug

David's Neighbour takes all security bugs in our projects seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our projects. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions and fix the underlying issues.

Report security bugs by emailing the security maintainer at [security@davids-neighbour.com](mailto:security@davids-neighbour.com).

The lead maintainer of the project will acknowledge your email within 48 hours and will send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavour to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure policy

After receiving the security bug report, a primary handler is assigned. This person coordinates the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

* Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
* Audit code to find similar problems.
* Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance. Those fixes will be released as fast and safe as possible.

## Comments on this policy

If you have suggestions on how we can improve this process [please submit a pull request](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/davids-neighbour.com/edit/main/content/policies/security/index.md) or an [issue report](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/davids-neighbour.com/issues).
