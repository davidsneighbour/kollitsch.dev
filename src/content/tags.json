Instead, I've gathered them here for you to enjoy.\n\nThe title of this series is a reference to the German word \"Kurzschnitte,\" which means \"short cuts.\" I coined this term back in 2000 when I moved to Lübeck and sent out short emails with news to my friends and family about my life. I fondly remember editions like the one where I recounted a search for my new \"home pub\" in Lübeck that led me to a gay bar with an Asian bartender in fluffy cow-patterned trousers. Little did I know.\n\nThe \"news\"letter evolved into what became my first blog, which I called \"Schreibblogade\" (writer's blogade, pun intended) - marking the beginning of an internet era.",
