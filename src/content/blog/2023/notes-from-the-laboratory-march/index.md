I am trying this new "thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year, and monthly reviews just sound like something normal people would do. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

- **kollitsch.dev:** You might have noticed, I am back on a light theme. This is not because I think light themes are nice (they aren't) but due to the fact that I somehow realised that I was not using the latest Bootstrap version. I am not sure how I missed that, but I did. So I updated the theme and now I am back on a light theme because Bootstrap 5.3 changed some things around with variables and theme schemes. I guess I will be back on a dark theme quite soon.
- **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
