*DarkSkies* is a fast and feature-rich theme for GoHugo, the fastest Static Site Generator (SSG) available. This theme is designed to provide an exceptional user experience, while also being highly customizable.

> [!WARNING]
> Please be aware that until recently DarkSkies was my own theme. I am now in the process of cutting it out of my personal website and into a standalone theme. This process will take some time and the theme might not work as expected. Please be patient, use the issue tracker for quite fast help with any issues that might occur, and check back later for updates.

## General notes

* The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
* I am working on Ubuntu, meaning all code samples in this document are working on Ubuntu and any comparable (Debian-based) Linux system. If you use another operating system, you are on your own. I assume most tools, scripts, and procedures should work on other systems with the appropriate changes because I mainly use open source programs and scripts.
