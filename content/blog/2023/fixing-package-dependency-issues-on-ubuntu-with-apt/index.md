Have you ever tried installing a program on your Ubuntu and ran into error messages about unconfigured dependencies? Don't worry; it happens to the best of us. For example, when you install a program, it might rely on other software packages to run correctly; if those dependencies are not met, the program won't work.

The following happened today when I tried to install [Local](https://localwp.com/) (a program that allows you to run a local WordPress on your computer):

```plaintext
$[patrick@main]~❯ sudo dpkg -i Downloads/local-6.6.1-linux.deb
Selecting previously unselected package local.

$[patrick@main]~❯
```

The interesting thing to note is that the program (in this case, `local`) was NOT fully installed. It was installed, but some dependencies were left uninstalled, and the program was not configured correctly.

What to do now?

The good news is that fixing this issue is easy with the `sudo apt install -f` command. This command checks for any broken dependencies in the package management system and automatically fixes them. Let's break down what each part of the command does:

*   `sudo`: The sudo command runs the command following with administrative or root privileges.
*   `apt`: The apt command is a package management utility in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions used to manage software packages.
*   `install`: The install command is used to install packages.
*   `-f`: The -f option stands for "fix" and is used to fix broken dependencies in the package management system.

When you run `sudo apt install -f`, the command will check for any missing or broken dependencies and attempt to fix them automatically. Afterward, it sets up all unconfigured packages. This can help ensure that your system runs smoothly and that all the necessary software packages are installed correctly.

Here's an example of running `sudo apt install -f` on my system that had broken dependencies after the command above:

Long story short: if you ever encounter any unconfigured dependencies while installing a program on Ubuntu, just remember to run `sudo apt install -f`, and you'll be good to go.
