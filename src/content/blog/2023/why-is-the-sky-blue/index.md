Did you ever ask yourself why the sky is blue? Here is what you need to know:

The color of the sky is a result of a phenomenon called [**Rayleigh scattering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering).

*   **Sunlight** is composed of different colors of light, each with its own wavelength - just think of [Pink Floyds album cover for The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon) or the [Rainbow flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_\(LGBT\)). These colors include **red**, **orange**, **yellow**, **green**, **blue**, **indigo**, and **violet**, with **red** having the longest wavelength and **violet** having the shortest.
*   When sunlight enters **Earth's atmosphere**, it interacts with tiny particles and molecules, such as **nitrogen** and **oxygen** --- just the stuff you find in the atmosphere. These particles are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, making them in-visible.
*   **Rayleigh scattering** occurs when these small particles scatter sunlight in all directions. However, shorter wavelengths of light, such as **blue** and **violet**, are scattered more effectively than longer wavelengths like **red** and **yellow**.
*   This leads to **blue** and **violet** light being scattered in all directions, resulting into the **blue** light that we see when we look at the sky from down here.
*   The human eye is more sensitive to **blue** light, which is why we perceive the sky as **blue** during the day.
*   When the sun then goes down, the light travels in a larger angle through the atmosphere, making us see more colors.

To keep it short: **the sky appears blue** because of the scattering of sunlight by atmospheric particles, with shorter **blue** wavelengths being scattered more than longer wavelengths. And we humans are just not evolved enough to see more than just **blue** in that case.

By the way, I am now on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/kollitsch.dev), too. The link to my profile there replaced the link to another former social network I am not frequenting anymore, now. Because they still have no logo (it seems) I am doing what they are doing themself and use a filled square as logo :) see you "in the sky"!
