Get ready for a twisty turn through the whimsical and weird in episode 5 of "Kurzschnitte"! This episode takes a dive into the quirky side of everyday life, proving that truth can indeed be stranger—and much more fun—than fiction. Buckle up, because you're in for a wild ride that will leave you both bewildered and begging for more!

### Webdev

* [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) enhances the classic dotenv library for managing environment variables in development environments. It introduces robust features like encrypted .env files, multi-environment support, and cross-platform compatibility. This tool aims to simplify and secure configuration management across different stages of software development.
* MicroJS provides a collection of micro-libraries, which are small JavaScript utilities and tools that help streamline and solve common development problems without the need for bulky libraries. For more details and to explore the available libraries, you might want to visit [MicroJS](https://microjs.com/#) directly.

### Learn

* Well I seem to be doing *something* right, because, as you can [read on ScienceAlert.com](https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting) drinking coffee *might* lower risks in connection with too much sitting, which is something we all are guilty of.
* The [CSS Spring Easing Generator at kvin.me](https://www.kvin.me/css-springs) is an innovative tool designed for web developers to create complex CSS spring animations. This generator simplifies the process of defining and using CSS spring animations with ready-to-use code snippets, enabling more dynamic and natural animation effects in web projects.

### Fun and stuff

* [Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/) is a compelling archive detailing the array of products, services, and devices that Google has discontinued. This site provides an in-depth look at the "transient nature" of tech innovations, serves as a digital memorial of Google's experimental ventures, and a reminder that nothing is for ever in your marriage with Google.
* [WhenFS](https://github.com/lvkv/whenfs) is a playful project on GitHub that transforms your Google Calendar into a FUSE filesystem. This creative experiment allows you to read, write, and even share files using Google Calendar events in an unconventional yet educational way. Dive into the quirky functionalities and codebase to explore the fusion of web services with file system operations.
* [Dumb Password Rules](https://dumbpasswordrules.com/sites/) is a satirical but also critical look at the frustrating password requirements imposed by various websites. This site lists examples of irrational and overly restrictive rules that make security cumbersome rather than effective.
