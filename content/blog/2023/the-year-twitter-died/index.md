There is this really well-written collection of articles on [2023, the year Twitter died](https://www.theverge.com/c/23972308/twitter-x-death-tweets-history-elon-musk) on The Verge.

> Twitter was so many things... Elon Musk killed Twitter. First he did it figuratively: firing most employees destabilizing it as a technology and a business, leaving the platform virtually unusable for those who remained. Then he killed it literally: renaming it X, giving Twitter a final ending after fifteen years of chaotic existence.
>
> But in death there is understanding --- now that it's over, we can reckon with what Twitter really was:
>
> * a news cycle accelerator,
> * a tool of mass harassment,
> * an idealistic money-losing workplace,
> * and an infinite joke machine.
>
> 2023 will go down as... THE YEAR TWITTER DIED.
