A list of technologies and tools I am using to build this website. 

- **Hosting:** I host this website on [Netlify](). With it's global edge CDN network and the free tier it's perfect for my current requirements (not many visitors, not much traffic). 
- **Static Site Generator:** This site is built with [GoHugo](), a static site generator written in Golang.
- **Form Handling:** Forms on this site are handled vie [Formspree.io]().
