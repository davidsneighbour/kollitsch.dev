## General notes

- The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
- I am working on Ubuntu, meaning all code samples in this document are working on Ubuntu and any comparable (Debian-based) Linux system. If you use another operating system, you are on your own. I assume most tools, scripts, and procedures should work on other systems with the appropriate changes because I mainly use open-source programs and scripts.

## Icons

The icons in this theme are from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). Whenever a configuration option asks for an icon or icon slug then you can use any of the icons from that library. For example, if you want to use the [chevron-double-up](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/chevron-double-up/) icon, you can use either `chevron-double-up`  as the value for the configuration option.
