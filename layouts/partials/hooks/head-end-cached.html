# preventing Firefox FOUC warning

Firefox tends to have FOUC and a message in the console: "Layout was forced
before the page was fully loaded. If stylesheets are not yet loaded this
may cause a flash of unstyled content." This disappears funnily enough by
adding this simple fix right before the closing header tags.
