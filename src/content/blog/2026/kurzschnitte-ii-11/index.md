Welcome to another edition of my collection of opened and orphaned browser tabs that never made it to the blog or other uses.

## WebDev

* Ending the year with a wink, the final entry of htmhell’s Advent Calendar reflects on everyday HTML pitfalls and hard-earned lessons from the trenches. The [2025 day 25 post](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/25/) is less about shiny new techniques and more about recognising patterns that quietly cause trouble, making it a fitting reminder that boring, well-understood markup is often the real superpower.

* Sticky headers are convenient until they are not, and this Frontend Masters article digs into that awkward middle ground. It walks through how to switch from `position: sticky` to `position: fixed` on scroll in a controlled way, with [“Toggle position: sticky to position: fixed on scroll”](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/toggle-position-sticky-to-position-fixed-on-scroll/) offering a pragmatic mix of CSS and JavaScript for layouts that need both elegance and predictability.

* Watching scroll events has long been the default for triggering UI changes, but it comes with performance costs. This post makes a clear case for using the Intersection Observer API instead, showing how it can replace scroll listeners with less code and better efficiency, especially for lazy loading and visibility checks, as explained in [Intersection Observer over scroll listener](https://pyk.sh/blog/2025-10-01-intersection-observer-over-scroll-listener).

## Tools

* EmojisTime bills itself as [the world's fastest and most accurate emoji search](https://emojistime.com/), promising quick access to thousands of emojis, text art, scenes, and kaomojis. It is part search engine, part emoji museum, and part toy box, aimed at people who want to browse, copy, or translate ideas into emoji without wading through clunky keyboard pickers.

* Building with Tailwind often means reinventing the same UI patterns, which is where [TailwindFlex](https://tailwindflex.com/) comes in handy. The site collects ready-made Tailwind CSS components and layouts you can browse, copy, and adapt, making it a practical shortcut for designers and developers who want solid building blocks without starting from a blank file.

* Choosing colours that look good *and* work together is harder than it sounds, and [Kigen Color](https://kigen.design/color) leans into that problem with an interactive approach. The tool lets you explore colour combinations visually, tweak values in real time, and see how changes affect balance and contrast, making it a useful companion when intuition alone stops being enough.

* Working with OKLCH often sounds theoretical until you can actually push sliders and see what happens. The creator at [oklch.fyi](https://oklch.fyi/create) turns the colour space into something tangible, letting you build and tweak palettes while watching lightness, chroma, and hue interact in real time, which makes it far easier to understand why OKLCH is gaining traction in modern design systems.

## Learn

* Opting out of invasive defaults can feel overwhelming, which is why the EFF breaks it down into manageable steps with its daily tips for Opt-Out October. The piece on [protecting your privacy and security](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/09/opt-out-october-daily-tips-protect-your-privacy-and-security) encourages small, practical changes - one per day - showing how incremental habits can meaningfully reduce digital exposure without requiring a full lifestyle reset.
*
* Dithering is one of those techniques that feels retro until you realise how relevant it still is. In [“Dithering, part 1”](https://visualrambling.space/dithering-part-1/), Visual Rambling walks through the basics of why and how dithering works, grounding the discussion in history, perception, and practical examples that show how limitations can become a deliberate aesthetic choice rather than a flaw.
