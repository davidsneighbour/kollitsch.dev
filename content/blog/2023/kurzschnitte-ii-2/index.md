Welcome to Kurzschnitte II, a collection of links I came across in recent weeks. These links were noteworthy to me, but I don't want to write a full blog post about them. Instead, I've gathered them here for you to enjoy.

*   The English language (according to [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/e/new-dictionary-words-fall-2023/)) now too has an entry for "verschlimmbessern" (I explained that in my [July notes](/2023/notes-from-the-laboratory-july)) --- pessimize --- and I fully agree.

*   Discover [Classnames](https://classnames.paulrobertlloyd.com/), a resource easing the naming of HTML classes, CSS properties, or JavaScript functions. It offers curated word lists, categorized thematically—actions to architecture—each linking to a Wordnik definition, blending creativity with utility in naming​.

Introducing Monaspace: Revolutionizing Code Display with Texture Healing
Monaspace is an innovative font superfamily designed specifically for coding, offering a unique feature called Texture Healing. This groundbreaking technique addresses the longstanding issue of uneven texture in monospaced typefaces, which typically arises from trying to fit each character into a uniform space. Texture Healing works by intelligently swapping adjacent characters, balancing narrow and wide characters to create a more uniform and visually appealing text density. This approach, leveraging OpenType's "contextual alternates," transforms the display of code, making Monaspace not just a font but a sophisticated tool for enhancing code readability and aesthetics.
