Welcome to the first edition of Kurzschnitte II, a collection of links I came across in recent weeks. These links were noteworthy to me, but I don't want to write a full blog post about them. Instead, I've gathered them here for you to enjoy.

The title of this series is a reference to the German word "Kurzschnitte," which means "short cuts." I coined this term back in 2000 when I moved to Lübeck and sent out short emails with news to my friends and family about my life. I fondly remember editions like the one where I recounted a search for my new "home pub" in Lübeck that led me to a gay bar with an Asian bartender in fluffy cow-patterned trousers. Little did I know.

The "news"letter evolved into what became my first blog, which I called "Schreibblogade" (writer's blogade, pun intended) - marking the beginning of an internet era.

Enough reminiscence. Enjoy these links!

* **[Elon Musk Today](https://elonmusk.today/):** A collection of Elon Musk's ~~vaporware~~ announcement tweets that are still waiting to come true. This list sadly isn't updated too regularly - the entire [cage fight story](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/13/business/zuckerberg-musk-cage-fight.html) is still missing.
* **[Understanding and Using WordPress Nonces Properly](https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/08/understand-and-use-wordpress-nonces-properly/):** A deep-dive article on the WordPress developer's blog about nonces, what they are, how they work, and how to use them properly.
* **[Bun Guides](https://bun.sh/guides):** A collection of code samples and walkthroughs for performing common tasks with Bun. In the past, we referred to these as "cookbooks," which I think is a much better name.
* **[Autosaving Form Data in the Background Using the fetch() API](https://www.bennadel.com/blog/4494-auto-saving-form-data-in-the-background-using-the-fetch-api.htm):** Ben Nadel shares his thoughts on autosaving form content using JavaScript's [fetch() API](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_fetch).
