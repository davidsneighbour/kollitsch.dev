I am trying this new "thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year, and monthly reviews just sound like something normal people would do. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

- **February:** I don't trust February. This month can't decide if it's 28 or 29 days long and it's also much shorter than any other month. It's an abomination.
- **Focus:** I started to organise my work time into bundles that are dedicated to specific tasks. I can do this because I don't have too many meetings these days. On one side I get things done, on the other that rigorous "time out" method at the end of the time bundle is leaving me with much needed notetaking tasks so I can find where to re-start next time I work on a project. The system has optimisation potential.
- **kollitsch.dev:** I worked through some design changes, but most of the time went into updating modules and features.
- **Language Learning:** I again didn't do much in this resort...
- **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
