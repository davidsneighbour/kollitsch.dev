I am trying this new "thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year, and monthly reviews just sound like something normal people would do. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

- **kollitsch.dev:** Last time I noted, that I need a proper search. After [some nudging by Bryce](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/kollitsch.dev/discussions/246#discussioncomment-5771538) I went ahead and implemented [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/). It took me 30 minutes of template changes and an hour of styling and we were done. Great. Find it under [find](/find/).
- **Global Warming:** I am not saying there is such a thing like global warming, but we had the hottest two months in April and May in Thailand I ever experienced since I moved here. And most of my computers are proof, as in they are dead. Either by overheating or by power surges. Now I am left bereft and starting to set up my little Raspberry Pi's for minuscule tasks like serving a preview website or playing binge-entertainment on the side. Also: HP computers are made for the tropics. They are the only ones that survived.
- **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
