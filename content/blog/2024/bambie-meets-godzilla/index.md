Animation has long been a medium that pushes creative boundaries. [Marv Newland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marv_Newland)'s iconic short "Bambi Meets Godzilla" does this. Originally released in 1969, this subversive animation with its minimalist style and dark humor, earned a lasting place in animation history. Created on a shoestring budget of less than $300, Newland's hand-drawn work showcases what can be achieved with creativity and a touch of absurdity.

Let [Wikipedia's entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_Meets_Godzilla) describe what is happening in this film:

> The opening credits, consisting entirely of roles filled by Newland himself, scroll over an image of Bambi serenely grazing on a field of grass and flowers while the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's recording of William Tell's Ranz des Vaches plays in the background. After the credits, Bambi looks up to see Godzilla's foot coming down, squashing him flat (set to the final chord of the Beatles' "A Day in the Life"). After a moment, the closing credits appear alongside the image of Godzilla's foot atop Bambi. The closing credits give acknowledgement to Tokyo "for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film". Godzilla's toe claws wiggle once and the cartoon ends.

Marv Newland's approach strips animation down to its essentials. The rough, hand-drawn style and minimal animation may seem rudimentary by today's standards, but this simplicity is precisely what gives the film its charm. The humor is in the unexpected twist, and the crude animation serves to emphasize the absurdity of the situation. "Bambi Meets Godzilla" quickly became a cult favorite, often shown as a filler in midnight movie screenings or animation festivals.

For anyone interested in animation history or indie filmmaking, "Bambi Meets Godzilla" is a must-watch, whether it's Marv Newland's original version or [Coda Shetterly's 4K re-creation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06RqWhOmBMU). Together, they celebrate the enduring appeal of animation's power to shock, amuse, and defying expectations.
