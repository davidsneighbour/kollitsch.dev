*pronunciation: /fÉªËˆnÉªÊƒÉªt/&#x20;*

Let's face it: the list of unfinished projects and ideas in my to-do lists has grown into a monster. My notebooks are a graveyard of (IMHO) great ideas and unpolished gems that never entirely made it to the finish line (or near it sometimes). Sounds familiar? Inspired by the principles --- well, ok, just the slogan --- of "Getting Things Done" and the relentless pursuit of actually achieving goals, I'm launching a new personal improvement initiative for this year: \*FiniShðŸ’©t\*. This project is about getting results, taking action, and closing the loop on those lingering ideas. And it's about sun setting ideas as if we were Google when it becomes clear that there won't be a finish line. It's better to know why something fails than to never acknowledge it failing at all.

## The Concept

The idea is simple: I'm committing to completing one project every week instead of letting tasks rot in the graveyard of good intentions. I'll dedicate just two hours to focus exclusively on finishing each project. This means no more overcomplicating, endless tweaking and optimizing, and no more excuses.

I'll document the journey in a blog post. These posts will cover:

* What the project was
* What progress I'd already made (if any)
* What challenges I faced
* How I "finished" it
* What I learned

The goal? Share insights, inspire others, and prove that perfection isn't necessary anymore â€” completion is.

## Why Now?

We're on the cusp of a new year (hihihi), a perfect time for resolutions and fresh starts. Rather than drafting a wish list of dreams that will gather dust or listing achievements and lessons I learned last year, I'm focusing on action. It's time to finish what I've started.

## Blog Posts

Expect an honest, no-frills account of each week's \*FiniShðŸ’©t!\* project. From minor tweaks to big ideas, each post will be a transparent look at:

* What I can achieve in two focused hours
* Strategies for overcoming procrastination
* Tips and tools I discover along the way

Whether you're a chronic procrastinator, overthinker, or just looking for a productivity boost, I hope these posts inspire you to take your unfinished projects and give them the final push they deserve.

I recently did a couple of little projects to kick things off and see if this concept works. It does.

Stay tuned for next week's first post: a Flickr (is that still a thing?) album downloader.
