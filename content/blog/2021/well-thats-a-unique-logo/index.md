I had a weird reaction ("well... that's a unique logo?") to my really great weblog logo above recently, so I thought I might as well explain it. 

1) Star Trek tops Star Wars (don't even start discussing this)
2) I am a wizard (I have people on record saying that about me)
3) I am a dog person (cats suck, they want to take over the world and dominate us, wake up!)
4) I like to research things, dive into details, find out why things are how they are (and you might too)
5) I was born in Germany and lived there for a little bit over 29 years of my life
6) I now live and work on an island (for 16+ years)
7) ... in Thailand (we might go into depth about that in a later post)
8) I work with computers (obviously)
9) Issac Asimov rules!!!11One (if you need further information please refer to logo part 4)
10) I create code
11) It's always a work in progress

That's it. Questions?

Sidenote: My first attempt at a kollitsch.de-logo was `<kollitsch.de/>` which everyone who codes for the web understands. This was merely immediately thwarted by [my developer friend Somrat](https://somrat.netlify.app/) who pointed out a distinctive similarity to his own logo. Which I couldn't let stand :wink:
