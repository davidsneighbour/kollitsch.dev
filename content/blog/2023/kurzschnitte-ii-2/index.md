Welcome to Kurzschnitte II, a collection of links I came across in recent weeks. These links were noteworthy to me, but I don't want to write a full blog post about them. Instead, I've gathered them here for you to enjoy.

*   The English language (according to [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/e/new-dictionary-words-fall-2023/)) now too has an entry for "verschlimmbessern" (I explained that in my [July notes](/2023/notes-from-the-laboratory-july)) --- pessimize --- and I fully agree.
