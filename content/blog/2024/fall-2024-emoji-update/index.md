In the fall of 2024, the Unicode Consortium will introduce a whimsical new array of emojis under Unicode Version 16.0, including a "hang-over" inspired emoji that humorously captures the essence of post-celebration woes. This update will see the addition of 5,187 new characters, among which are eight fresh emojis designed to enrich our digital expressions further. The inclusion of these emojis, alongside significant expansions such as additional Egyptian Hieroglyph characters, reflects Unicode's ongoing mission to support diverse and dynamic forms of communication across global digital platforms.

The "face with bags under eyes" emoji humorously captures feelings of fatigue or exhaustion, often relatable after a long night or a tiring experience. This addition to the emoji repertoire brings a playful way to express those less-than-perky moments, resonating with anyone who's ever felt the wear and tear of a sleepless night or the aftermath of a lively celebration.
