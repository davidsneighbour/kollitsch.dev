Welcome to the fifth edition of Kurzschnitte II, where coding mets quintessence!

## Webdev

- [dotenvx](https://dotenvx.com/) enhances the classic dotenv library for managing environment variables in development environments. It introduces robust features like encrypted .env files, multi-environment support, and cross-platform compatibility. This tool aims to simplify and secure configuration management across different stages of software development.
- MicroJS provides a collection of micro-libraries, which are small JavaScript utilities and tools that help streamline and solve common development problems without the need for bulky libraries. For more details and to explore the available libraries, you might want to visit [MicroJS](https://microjs.com/#) directly.

## Learn

- Well I seem to be doing _something_ right, because, as you can [read on ScienceAlert.com](https://www.sciencealert.com/drinking-coffee-may-lower-risk-of-death-from-too-much-sitting) drinking coffee _might_ lower risks in connection with too much sitting, which is something we all are guilty of.
- The [CSS Spring Easing Generator at kvin.me](https://www.kvin.me/css-springs) is an innovative tool designed for web developers to create complex CSS spring animations. This generator simplifies the process of defining and using CSS spring animations with ready-to-use code snippets, enabling more dynamic and natural animation effects in web projects.
- A deep dive into the essentials of email security can be learned on ["SPF, DKIM, DMARC Simplified" by Nicanor Flavier](https://github.com/nicanorflavier/spf-dkim-dmarc-simplified). This article breaks down the complex topics of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC in an accessible manner, offering explanations and real-world applications to ensure your emails reach their intended recipients securely. Perfect for developers and administrators looking to learn about safeguarding their email communications.

## Watch

- [Patrick Stewart performing a soliloquy on the letter B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA7lv1SDzno) on Sesame Street. 'Nuff said.
- A perfect mix of two of my interests, Kintsugi and Oreo: [The art of Kintsugi with Oreo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spY2SsCKOSQ). The video showcases how Oreo creatively applies the ancient Japanese technique of Kintsugi, which is the repairing of broken objects with gold, symbolizing beauty in imperfection. This unique campaign highlights a fascinating blend of cultural art and modern marketing.

## Fun and stuff

- [Killed by Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/) is a compelling archive detailing the array of products, services, and devices that Google has discontinued. This site provides an in-depth look at the "transient nature" of tech innovations, serves as a digital memorial of Google's experimental ventures, and a reminder that nothing is for ever in your marriage with Google.
- [WhenFS](https://github.com/lvkv/whenfs) is a playful project on GitHub that transforms your Google Calendar into a FUSE filesystem. This creative experiment allows you to read, write, and even share files using Google Calendar events in an unconventional yet educational way. Dive into the quirky functionalities and codebase to explore the fusion of web services with file system operations.
- [Dumb Password Rules](https://dumbpasswordrules.com/sites/) is a satirical but also critical look at the frustrating password requirements imposed by various websites. This site lists examples of irrational and overly restrictive rules that make security cumbersome rather than effective.
