Welcome to the sixth edition of Kurzschnitte II. Did you know that six is the smallest positive integer which is neither a square number nor a prime number? Now you know.

## Webdev

- Pawel Grzybek's blog post on [What's New in ECMAScript 2024](https://pawelgrzybek.com/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2024/) delves into the latest features approved in the ECMAScript 2024 Language Specification. The update includes sophisticated functions for managing Unicode strings, enhancing regex capabilities, and improving JavaScript's handling of ArrayBuffers and promises.
- [Swapy](https://swapy.tahazsh.com/) is a versatile tool that turns any layout into a drag-to-swap interface with minimal coding. It's framework-agnostic, supporting various environments like React, Vue, and Svelte. Swapy offers features like customizable slots and items, event listening for swaps, and dynamic animations, making it a handy resource for interactive web development projects.
- [Pocket ID](https://github.com/stonith404/pocket-id) is a straightforward OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider designed for simplicity in authenticating users via passkeys. Unlike more complex systems like Keycloak or ORY Hydra, Pocket ID focuses solely on passkey authentication, eliminating the need for passwords. #selfhosted
- [git-sync](https://github.com/AkashRajpurohit/git-sync) is a CLI tool designed to help developers backup their Git repositories. It offers features like automatic cloning or updating of all your GitHub repositories to a local directory, using bare clones to save space and speed up the process, and the ability to sync multiple repositories concurrently. It supports all major Git hosting services like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
- The [Gradient Generator](https://www.learnui.design/tools/gradient-generator.html) is a tool that helps create beautiful, vivid gradients without the common pitfalls of banding and gray dead zones often found in design software. This tool offers advanced options across various perceptually uniform color spaces, ensuring smooth color transitions for web and graphic design. Perfect for designers seeking to add dynamic, rich backgrounds to their visual projects.
- [Local AI Stack](https://github.com/ykhli/local-ai-stack) is a GitHub project designed to enable developers to create and run AI applications locally without incurring costs. It features tools for document-based Q&A applications using technologies like Ollama for inference and Supabase for database management. This setup ensures that developers can build and deploy AI functionalities within their applications without relying on cloud services or just try out their ideas locally without having a data-kraken involved in their personal AI journey.
- [`caniuse-cli`](https://github.com/bramus/caniuse-cli) by bramus provides a command-line tool that leverages data from "Can I Use" and MDN Browser Compatibility to deliver instant, offline compatibility results for various web technologies. It collapses versions with the same support level, includes notes, and supports tab autocompletion in shells like zsh, bash, and fish.
- [llmstxt.org](https://llmstxt.org/) proposes the standardization of the `/llms.txt` file for websites to provide LLMs with concise, relevant information in Markdown format. This initiative aims to optimize how language models access and utilize web content, enhancing their efficiency in real-time user assistance and web navigation. Basically a robots.txt for AI bots. 

## Learn

- Dive into the realities of JavaScript failing to load. There are plenty more reasons than just the old "disabled" and ["A handful of reasons JavaScript wonâ€™t be available"](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-handful-of-reasons-javascript-wont-be-available/) by Andy Bell on Piccalilli lists various scenarios, from poor connections to browser restrictions, underscoring the importance of designing with progressive enhancement to ensure your website remains accessible and usable without JavaScript.
- The [Work-ready Next.js](https://www.sanity.io/learn/track/work-ready-next-js) track on Sanity.io offers a series of lessons designed to help developers build functional, content-driven web applications using Sanity and Next.js. It focuses on foundational practices, caching strategies for high performance, and integrated visual editing to enhance content authorship. This learning path is aimed at providing the tools and knowledge necessary for creating efficient and collaborative web environments, deployable via GitHub to Vercel.

## Food for though

- Explore the concept of "Kinwork" over traditional networking through an insightful blog post on [Everything Changes](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/make-kin-not-nets/). The post critiques traditional networking as a dehumanizing act that reduces relationships to mere transactions. It advocates for "Kinwork," which emphasizes creating and nurturing genuine connections, supporting emotional and material needs, and fostering a community of care and support. This approach, enriched by Donna Haraway's concept of oddkin, values life and community over capital.

## Fun and stuff

- [Public Work](https://public.work/) is a search engine dedicated to finding public domain content, offering access to over 100,000 copyright-free images from prestigious sources like The MET and the New York Public Library. This tool is ideal for researchers, creatives, and educators in need of high-quality, royalty-free visuals for various projects.
- [Domain Watchdog](https://github.com/maelgangloff/domain-watchdog) is a versatile tool for all you domain campers out there, utilizing RDAP to track and manage domain names on your wish list. It allows users to automatically monitor domain status and even purchase domains when they become available. It also has a dog as logo, so there you have it.
- If you are like me you don't like watching hour-long videos about new features and tutorials for libraries. [YouTube Summaries](https://www.youtubesummaries.com/) is a platform designed to help you with that and provides concise, AI-generated summaries of YouTube videos. This tool is ideal for quickly grasping the main points of longer videos.
- This article on [Data Genetics](http://datagenetics.com/blog/september32012/index.html) explores common and uncommon four-digit PIN numbers, analyzing patterns from a dataset of exposed passwords. It highlights the predictability of frequently chosen PINs, like "1234" or year numbers and discusses the implications for security. The less common PINs, like "8068," are also examined. I think though, that 8068 might have lost it's place as least common PIN now that it had been exposed ;)
