**Hello again, Internet!** You might not know me, but you probably already somewhere came across my work or myself if you ended up here. My name is Patrick (born 1975). I am a German, living on Koh Samui in Thailand and I am a web worker. Let me give you a short summary of how we got here and where we go from here :smile:

On a sunny October day in the year 1997 I entered the PC-pool of the university of applied science I studied at, logged onto "The Internet&trade;" and never left since. I spent the following 4 years studying the subject of Industrial Management and Engineering, but most of the time I spent on the adolescent web. I created my first "company" (more some form of extra-curricular work group) named **Kreaktivo** (a mixture of "creative" and "active" in German) that helped companies to get aquainted with and the most out of the new online worlds we were subjected to. 

In that time I started my first Blog, "Die Schreibbloggade" (the writer's block with the back then required weblog reference). After moving to a street called "Fischergrube" (fishers pit) in Luebeck, in the north of Germany a second likewise blog was added. I organised an annual music CD playlist swap and created a website (back then we did not call that communities) that covered and listed new weblog entries of the German blogosphere, called Weblogmonitor and later Blogbot. 

Leaving the university in 2001 I set up my own company and promptly run it into the grounds some years later (with having neither business plan or experience being the main reasons). Companies I worked for in that time were [Draeger](https://www.draeger.com/) in L&uuml;beck and other but much smaller companies in northern Germany. 

Fast forward to 2004 and you find me employed by a company in Berlin, that dabbles in online education and prepeared to open a developer's branch in Thailand. I found that interesting, applied, got accepted and ended up travelling to Thailand on January 8th of 2005. I did not stay for long with that company, but stayed in Thailand and in 2006 opened my own business [**David's Neighbour**](https://davids-neighbour.com/) and work as a freelancer since then here on our beautiful island of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand.

In 2005 I was mostly working with a small website builder system called [Textpattern](https://textpattern.com/) and "hated" [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) with all my heart (mostly due to nearly monthly security holes that made life of existing websites quite hard). This of course changed over time and I ended up using (via many years of [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) work) static website generators. 

Then came Corona (Covid-19) (*meaningful pause*). 

On March 18th 2020 Thailand closed all country borders and tourism, tourism operators and companies depending on tourism --- my main income source (well, Samui is an island and one of the top 3 tourist spots in Thailand) --- instantly died down. 

[**David's Neighbour**](https://davids-neighbour.com/) is an agency, that depends on word of mouth marketing. All my customers found me by talking to someone who I helped to establish, optimise or increase business. I don't complain, but I realised in the past two years, that my online footprint is not large enough to "instantly" create new business and income. Which brings us to the *NOW* and *WHY* of this weblog. I completely ignored to create some form of online reputation for myself (references, references, references) and lost quite some opportunities in the past two years due to this. 

I always had some form of company site or personal blog in the works, but never quite got around to getting to the point of publishing it. 

The plan for *this blog* is to remedy this by finally have some form of online tech-blog with my thoughts and tips about current topics and the things I know. 

I actually started back in 2005 to create a tech-blog, where I wanted to post "stuff of interest and things I know", but I ended up being trapped in a never-ending spiral of optimising and rebuilding. Up to today I have 7 different never-published tech-blogs that died down due to perfectionism, imposter syndrome and technological advancement. Not anymore. I shall kick this blog out there, as imperfectionist as it is.

That's all. Welcome again. Welcome back. Kind of. 

**Sidenote:** This site is work in progress and not much except the blog entries themself are working properly. Bear with me. I will add a form to notify me about topics you want me to write about, questions on how I built certain parts of the site and anything else you want to get off your chest. I am also aware that the site looks quite chaotic, which is due to me transposing the underlying theme from [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) to [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/).
