# General notes

* The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).
* I am working on Ubuntu, meaning all code samples in this document are working on Ubuntu and any comparable (Debian-based) Linux system. If you use another operating system, you are on your own. I assume most tools, scripts, and procedures should work on other systems with the appropriate changes because I mainly use open-source programs and scripts.
