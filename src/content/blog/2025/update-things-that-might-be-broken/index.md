Things in this realm are expected to be broken right now :] I spent the past few weeks migrating my website to a new framework and I am still in the process of getting everything up and running again. The blog is mostly working, but some links might be broken, some images might not load, and the design is not yet final - mostly because I, in addition to the migration, also migrated away from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS. When we break down the walls then we might as well break the whole house down and rebuild completely, right? :]
