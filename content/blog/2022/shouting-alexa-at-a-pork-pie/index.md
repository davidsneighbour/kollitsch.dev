This really important video about Alexa is a great example of how to use the Alexa API to create a skill. Not really, but watch it until the end to understand ;)

From [the videos description](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCkcoNYbbuU):

> Some interpreted it as a commentary on our over-reliance on consumerism, or of the unrealistic demands we make of material possessions. Thus, extending this joke allows space for the audienceâ€™s own interpretation - allowing people with very different comedic preferences to enjoy it equally
