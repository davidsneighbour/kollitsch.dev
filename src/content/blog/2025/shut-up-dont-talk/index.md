Movie theaters should be sacred spaces, free from distractions. But some people just don't get it. That's where Alamo Drafthouse's legendary PSA series comes in—reminding moviegoers, in the most entertaining ways possible, to keep quiet.

The latest installment features **John Lithgow** and **Geoffrey Rush**, two acting legends, delivering a hilariously intense warning to theater disruptors. Lithgow, with his signature theatricality, and Rush, whose brilliance has captivated me since *Shine*, make it clear: No talking, no texting, or else.

Alamo Drafthouse has a [history of enlisting contemporary actors for these PSAs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpX5OvrhWl9I59CYEx_ZtXnSmpBQEDbWe), and this one is an instant classic. Lithgow's dramatic delivery? Perfect. Rush's commanding presence? Flawless. And if you don't take them seriously—well, let's just say you don't want to mess with *the Muffin Man*.

Check out the PSA and, for the love of cinema, **silence your phone**.
