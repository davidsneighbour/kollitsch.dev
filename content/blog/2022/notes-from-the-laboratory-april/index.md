I am trying this new "thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year, and monthly reviews just sound like something normal people would do. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

- **Focus:** The fact, that I found a bug in my [@davidsneighbour/hugo-pwa module](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-pwa) while doing this writeup and fixing it subsequently before finishing this writeup is a sign that focusing on important things is still an issue.
- **Header tags and social media tags:** For a while now I was working on a module that creates all the header tags a website could possibly need. After some cleaning up and fine tuning it's finally ready to be released as a proper module. In it's wake we have two other modules that take care of "everything social" and "everything image" on my websites.
- **Fixing things:**
- **Cleanup:**
- **kollitsch.de:**
- **Customers:**
- **Cooking:**
- **Pokki:**
- **Language Learning:**
- **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
