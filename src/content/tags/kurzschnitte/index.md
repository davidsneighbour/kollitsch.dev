Kurzschnitte II is a collection of links I came across in recent weeks. These links were noteworthy to me, but I don't want to write a full blog post about them. Instead, I've gathered them here for you to enjoy.

The title of this series is a reference to the German word "Kurzschnitte," which means "short cuts." I coined this term back in 2000 when I moved to Lübeck and sent out short emails with news to my friends and family about my life. I fondly remember editions like the one where I recounted a search for my new "home pub" in Lübeck that led me to a gay bar with an Asian bartender in fluffy cow-patterned trousers. Little did I know.

The "news"letter evolved into what became my first blog, which I called "Schreibblogade" (writer's blogade, pun intended) - marking the beginning of an internet era.
