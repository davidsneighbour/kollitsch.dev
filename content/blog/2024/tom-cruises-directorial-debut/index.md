Did you know that Tom Cruise made his directorial debut back in 1993, long before he started jumping out of planes and buildings? He directed an episode of the noir TV series *Fallen Angels*, an obscure little gem titled "Mitch Allison, Boozer, Grifter, and Loser," that no one seems to remember. Let's dive into this fascinating piece of television history.

## The plot

Based on a story by Jim Thompson, the episode follows Mitch Allison (played by *Peter Gallagher*), a small-time grifter who "borrowed" $25,000 from his con-artist wife, Bette (*Nancy Travis*). Mitch planned to double the money by taking advantage of some easy marks on a train bound for Vegas (those friendly old people in the article image above). But things went wrong when he lost everything. Stranded in the desert, his situation takes an even stranger turn when he crosses paths with the fiery Babe (*Isabella Rossellini*) and her hapless husband (*John C. Reilly*). Together, they find themselves tangled in a scam far more dangerous than Mitch imagined.

## Tom Cruise, this time behind the camera

What makes this episode intriguing is that it marks Tom Cruise's first and only time directing a TV episode. Unlike his usual roles as a strange running lead actor, Cruise stepped behind the camera, bringing a unique perspective to this noir tale of deceit and double-crossing. The episode is filled with quirky characters and unpredictable twists, showing Cruise's early potential as a storyteller with a sharp eye for drama and suspense.

Fallen Angels is a 1990s American neo-noir anthology TV series set in Los Angeles, featuring different crime stories each episode, inspired by classic noir fiction. The show features a rotating cast of well-known actors and directors, with a distinctive 1940s-1950s aesthetic, focusing on dark, atmospheric storytelling typical of film noir.

## Why This Episode Is Worth Revisiting

Though this *Fallen Angels* episode aired way back in 1993 and hasn't gained much recognition since, it offers a unique glimpse into Tom Cruise's creative evolution. Featuring a stellar cast, including the always captivating Isabella Rossellini and John C. Reilly before both their major career paths, the episode has a compelling mix of dark humor and gritty desert drama.

If you're a fan of film noir, quirky con-man tales, or simply curious to see what Cruise was up to creatively in the early '90s, this episode is a must-watch. It's a rare piece of television that perfectly captures the essence of noir storytellingâ€”deception, betrayal, and a desperate search for a way out.

The show is relatively obscure, so finding it in a better quality might be a bit challenging.
