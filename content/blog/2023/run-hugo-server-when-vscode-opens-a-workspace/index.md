I recently realised that every time I opened a certain project, I was running the same sequence of actions and commands to start the Hugo server. This involved opening a terminal, navigating to the project folder, and executing `npm run server`.

To streamline this process, I decided to leverage the `tasks.json` file in VSCode for automation. I created a task that runs the command `npm run server` and added it to my project. Now, every time I open my project, the Hugo server starts automatically.

Here is the content of my `tasks.json` file:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Hugo Server",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "npm run server",
      "windows": {
        "command": "npm run server",
      },
      "group": "none",
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "new"
      },
      "runOptions": {
        "runOn": "folderOpen",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation of Properties:**

- **label**: A unique name for the task, here it's `"Hugo Server"`.
- **type**: The type of task, `"shell"` in this case, indicating a shell command.
- **command**: The command to be executed, `"npm run server"` for starting the Hugo server
- **windows**: Platform-specific settings. Here, it repeats the same command for Windows.
- **group**: The group classification of the task, `"none"` means it's not part of any predefined group.
- **presentation**: How the task's output is displayed.
  - **reveal**: When to show the terminal, `"always"` in this case.
  - **panel**: Where to display the output, `"new"` opens a new panel.
- **runOptions**: Additional execution settings.
  - **runOn**: When the task should run, `"folderOpen"` means it executes when the project folder (or workspace) is opened.

This configuration ensures that every time the specified workspace is opened, the Hugo server is automatically started, which saves a lot of my precious time ;)... it's also convenient.
