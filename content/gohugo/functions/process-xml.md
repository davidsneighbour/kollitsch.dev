### Overview

The `[params.book]` configuration in the TOML file is designed to define a `book` object with various properties and nested elements that correspond to XML elements and attributes. This structure is highly configurable and can be tailored to fit specific XML output requirements.

### Structure Description

* **[params.book]**
  * **Purpose**: Acts as the root element for the book information. In the XML output, it corresponds to the `<book>` tag.
  * **Attributes**:
    * **published**: A boolean attribute (e.g., `true` or `false`) that signifies whether the book is published. It is represented as an attribute of the `<book>` element in the XML output.

* **title**
  * **Purpose**: Represents the title of the book.
  * **Value**: A string representing the book's title (e.g., "some title").
  * **[params.book.title.attributes]**
    * **isbn**: Represents the ISBN number of the book as an attribute of the `<title>` element in the XML.

* **[params.book.author]**
  * **Purpose**: Contains information about the author of the book. This will be represented as a nested `<author>` element within the `<book>` tag.
  * **Nested Properties**:
    * **name**: A string representing the author's name.
    * **location**: A string representing the author's location, which can be a city or any geographical designation.

### TOML Configuration Example

Hereâ€™s how you might set up this structure in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[params.book]
[params.book.attributes]
published = "true"

[params.book.title]
value = "some title"
[params.book.title.attributes]
isbn = "12345"

[params.book.author]
name = "some name"
location = "samui"
```

### XML Output Representation

Based on the above configuration, the XML output would look something like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<book published="true">
  <title isbn="12345">some title</title>
  <author>
    <name>some name</name>
    <location>samui</location>
  </author>
</book>
```

### Usage Notes

* The TOML configuration provides a clear and structured way to define the content and attributes for XML generation using GoHugo.
* Attributes for each element are defined in sub-tables named `attributes` to clearly separate element properties from their attributes.
* Each main property (like `title`, `author`) corresponds to a sub-element within the `<book>` XML tag, making it straightforward to manage complex data structures and translate them into XML format.

This structured approach allows users to easily understand the mapping between the TOML configuration and the XML structure, facilitating easier content management and template creation within GoHugo environments.
