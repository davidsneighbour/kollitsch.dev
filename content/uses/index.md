The following is a collection of tools helping me with my digital and work life. My main focus lies in applications that are open source and usable across operating systems. This is a collection in progress, so check back or subscribe to updates to know when there is something new to know about.

## Operating System

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is my main operating system. I use it on my desktop, and it's running on a server I am using. The last time I used Windows on my desktop was in 2004

## Productivity

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/) is my main task manager. I use it to manage my daily tasks, and I am using it to manage my projects. I am using it on the phone, via the Linux app, and via webinterface

## Privacy and Security

My password manager of choice is [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) and I am using it on all my devices.

## Notes, drafts and writing

For handwritten notes I am using [reMarkable](https://remarkable.com) and for digital notes I am using [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).
