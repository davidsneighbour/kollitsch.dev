My currently favourite developer font is Jetbrains Mono. ([Stefon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwm_N2PCUz8) voice on) It has everything! Distinctive characters (no more wondering if that is a zero or an uppercase O), code ligatures and more more more (Stefon voice off). I personally like the way the ligatures give a unique and coherent look to my editor experience. `=> <> !==` (the code display on this site is by the way formatted using Jetbrains Mono) and the like look nice, quickly identifyable and compact.

Using the font in VSCode is quite easy, just add the following to your settings:

```jsonc
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
=>
```

You can find the font on [Jetbrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). It is licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 and can be used for peronal and commercial projects alike. The font is also available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) and [Github](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono).

The font also supports148 languages. Not Thai though ;]
