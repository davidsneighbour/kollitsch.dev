I am trying this new "thing" of "reporting" what I was up to in a certain time period this year, and monthly reviews just sound like something normal people would do. So bear with me while I am typing up this report.

- **Cleanup:** I (semi)officially published some of my modules now and moved the documentation onto this website. Mostly because for some of the modules it became a very long README.md file. I think it's better to have a quick start guide on the README.md and here then a (maybe even deeply structured) documentation for these modules. Right now it's mostly cut-and-paste docs, working on it. The officially published modules are:

  - [hugo-debug](/components/hugo-debug/)
  - [hugo-feeds](/components/hugo-feeds/)
  - [hugo-head](/components/hugo-head/)
  - [hugo-hooks](/components/hugo-hooks/)
  - [hugo-icons](/components/hugo-icons/)
  - [hugo-internals](/components/hugo-internals/)
  - [hugo-netlification](/components/hugo-netlification/)
  - [hugo-pwa](/components/hugo-pwa/)
  - [hugo-robots](/components/hugo-robots/)
  - [hugo-security](/components/hugo-security/)
  - [hugo-sitemap](/components/hugo-sitemap/)

  I am also playing around with the thought of bundling some of these modules into collections to decrease the impact of loading them each time the server starts. It's probably just a nice build script that is missing.

- **kollitsch.de:** Away with the boxes and playing around with the theme.
- **Language Learning:** I am still following my GoLang online course. I am pretty sure whoever invented this language is located somewhere on a certain spectrum.
- **All the other stuff:** As always there was a lot of things that I just ignored or let slide. That's life. I guess.
