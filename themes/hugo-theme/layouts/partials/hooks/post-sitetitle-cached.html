    I recently reworked the theme of my site in a dark and light theme with Bootstrap 5.3 - it's still in an Alpha
    version, but I guess it's good enough to go. If you find anything unreadable (graphically ;]) or visually impairing
    feel free to contact me about it. 🐻 Bear with me in these hard times.
