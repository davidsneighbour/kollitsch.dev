During difficult times, [Pantone has chosen Peach Fuzz as its color of the year 2024](https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/what-is-peach-fuzz/). Peach Fuzz promotes community, togetherness, and self-awareness. It conveys a message of compassion and empathy, reflecting our desire for simpler times with a contemporary touch.

Pantone color codes are unsuitable for web design because they are designed for print media, using specific ink formulas. This differs from the RGB, HEX or any other codes used in web design, which are based on light, color tones and screen displays. While Pantone can guide digital color choices, direct conversion is not accurate due to variations in screen calibrations.

When RGB or HEX values are preferred for consistent color representation online then the nearest equivalents for Peach Fuzz are the following values:

| Mode  | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Hex | #ffbe98 |
| RGB | 255, 190, 152 |
| HSL | 22°, 100%, 80% |
| HSV | 22°, 40%, 100% |
| CMYK | 0%, 25%, 40%, 0% |

{{< colorscheme >}}
{{% color css="#ffbe98" scheme="dark" %}}
{{% color css="rgb(255, 190, 152)" scheme="dark" %}}
{{% color css="hsl(22deg, 100%, 80%)" scheme="dark" %}}
{{< / colorscheme >}}

Its soothing and calming colors certainly look nice on my website ;)
