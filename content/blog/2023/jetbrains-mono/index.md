<!-- vale Vale.Repetition = NO -->

My currently favourite developer font is Jetbrains Mono. ([Stefon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwm_N2PCUz8) voice on) It has everything! Distinctive characters (no more wondering if that is a zero or an uppercase O), code ligatures and more more more (Stefon voice off). I personally like the way the ligatures give a unique and coherent look to my editor experience. `=> <> !==` (the code display on this site is by the way formatted using Jetbrains Mono) and they look nice, quickly identifiable and compact.

<!-- vale Vale.Repetition = YES -->

Using the font in VSCode is quite easy, just add the following to your settings:

```jsonc
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

You can find the font on [Jetbrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). It is licensed under the SIL Open Font License 1.1 and can be used for personal and commercial projects alike. The font is also available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) and [Github](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono).

The font also supports 148 languages. Not Thai though ;]
