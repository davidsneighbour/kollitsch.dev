White this repository is available publicly all `content` is subject to copyright and may not be re-used or copied into other website projects. The `content` is obviously everything in the `content` folder. Other parts of this project like `assets` and `layouts` are available for educational uses and can be used. The theme in it's full may not be reused, but studied and parts reused.

Long story short: go and create something by yourself and if you want to know how I did realise a feature feel free to have a look.
