Geoffrey Huntley writes an extensive explanation on how "[Visual Studio Code is designed to fracture](https://ghuntley.com/fracture/)" and unburies some (well, expected) shadyness on the part of Microsoft.

The long story short version is summarised at the end:

> In short, this is what Microsoft did:
>
> - Created VSCode and made it the best and open-source IDE that everyone would jump to first.
> - Make a proprietary free distribution of it, along with proprietary free extensions for the various languages.
> - Make those extensions the best version possible and slow down focus on open source ones, often deprecating them.
> - Now you have to use the closed form of VSCode to have the best experience by quite a bit.
> - Everyone else using VSCode as a platform can't keep up because Microsoft fractured their community -- and your VSCode product is now just an ad for a similar Microsoft product that doesn't have all the papercuts.
