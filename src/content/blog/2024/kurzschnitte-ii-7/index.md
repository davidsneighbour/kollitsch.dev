Welcome to the seventh iteration of Kurzschnitte II. The number 7 is, in mathematics, the first prime number followed by a cube. Statistically, it appears as a common favorite number over many fields in daily life, religions, and mythologies. It also plays a crucial role in gaming, where rolling a seven can be pivotal in games like craps. In nature, there are seven days in a week, and it goes on… as do we with our list of links of interest.

## Webdev

* The [style-observer](https://github.com/bramus/style-observer) by Bramus is a library designed for monitoring changes in CSS property values on HTML elements using the browser's native IntersectionObserver. This library makes it possible to react to style changes driven by CSS, JavaScript, or user interactions, without requiring additional event listeners or polling mechanisms, enhancing performance and simplifying the development process for dynamic web applications.

## Learn

* The HTTP standard is not as fixed and unmovable as it seems to be, there is a draft for the new QUERY attribute (a mix of GET and POST). The IETF draft titled [HTTP: Safe Methods with Bodies](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body-05.html) discusses proposed updates to HTTP that would allow body payloads in requests using traditionally "safe" methods like GET. This could enhance capability without compromising the safety promises of these methods.

## Auditing

* [ObsoHTML](https://github.com/j9t/obsohtml) is a tool designed for detecting obsolete and proprietary HTML elements and attributes in various file types like HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. It's particularly useful for ensuring web standards are met in your projects. This Node.js script offers functionalities to run checks either globally or in specified directories, providing a detailed output of detected issues for easy updating. The project is open-source under the CC-BY-SA-4.0 license.

## Food for though

* [Going Buildless](https://mxb.dev/blog/buildless/) on mxb.dev explores the appeal and feasibility of a development approach without build processes, highlighting direct browser file delivery from code editors. It discusses the trade-offs, especially around performance, and the challenges of including HTML imports natively. Techniques using web components and server-side enhancements, such as Cloudflare Workers for dynamic content integration, are covered. The post also touches on CSS and JavaScript practices that support a buildless workflow, promoting simpler development for smaller projects. Back to where we started, with an FTP client and a browser.
* Dave Rupert's [take on crafting better forms](https://daverupert.com/2024/09/good-forms/) provides insights into how to improve form usability and aesthetics, focusing on practical design decisions that enhance user interaction and data accuracy and many other tips in what he calls "a dogpile". I think his tips are particularly valuable for designers looking to refine their approach to form elements and overall user experience.
* [Alarming revelations about a rogue WHOIS server](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/rogue-whois-server-gives-researcher-superpowers-no-one-should-ever-have/) that granted a researcher undue access powers, highlighting a severe security risk that exposes domain ownership to potential exploitation. This situation underscores a critical vulnerability in domain management systems, posing significant risks to domain owners.

## Fun and stuff

* Explore [the 2024 Ig Nobel Prize winners](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/09/meet-the-winners-of-the-2024-ig-nobel-prizes/) on Ars Technica, highlighting the quirky and humorous achievements in science that first make people laugh, then think. This year's honorees include birds guiding missiles, detecting drunk worms via chromotography, and research into coin flips (they tend to land on the same side they are are started on).
